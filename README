This project is Arduino and Python/Twisted code to implement a simplest-
possible 'office weather station' that presents temperature and relative
humidity readings via a webserver interface.

The sensors are:
 * LM35CAZ Nice, TO-92 cased, temperature sensor with 0-5VDC output and no
   external components required. A few bucks from National.

 * Ohmic Instruments SC-600 humidity sensor and signal conditioning module.

   About $15, quite cheap for a sensor this nice. You need an external RC
   lowpass, so two more components in the circuit. See the PDF.

Software:
 * The Arduino sketch simply sends the two ADC counts, as integers, on
   a single text line once per second, nothing else.
 * The Python code, implemented as a Twisted app, uses their LineReceiver
   class to get notifications of each new line, after which it does the 
   parsing, linearization and units. Overkill but simple.

   The twisted code also adds a simplest-possible HTTP interface, running on
   port 2000. The format used is designed for ingestion into Cacti, for nice
   time-based RRD graphs.
